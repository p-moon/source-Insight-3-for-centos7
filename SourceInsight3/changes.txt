--Change History for Source Insight version 3.50.0076--

Fix: Draft View was showing source code in monochrome. Draft view is supposed
to show only color formatting, but not font or font size changes.

--Change History for Source Insight version 3.50.0075--

Fix: Crash when searching with certain regular expression patterns.

Fix: Crash when synchronizing projects and building the search index, which 
was caused by very long identifier names.

Fix: When using Search and Replace and the replacement string was empty, then 
the search would skip over the next character.

Fix: Crash in some cases during project synchronization if an error occurred 
updating the symbol database for a particular source file. It now skips the 
problem file and continues with synchronization.

Fix: Searching with the "whole words only" option would not find matches if the 
search pattern contained multiple words. For example, searching for "dog cat" 
with "whole words only" would fail to find some instances.

Fix: Crash could occur if a display Style contained both a "font size" AND a
"font scale" value.

Fix: Crash could occur when exiting Source Insight on Window 8/8.1.

Update: The C/C++ token macros (in the c.tom file) were updated with more definitions.

Update: Code signing certificate was renewed.

Change: Switched to InstallShield for the installer program. Be sure to run as
an Administrator when you run the setup program.

Change: The default font was changed to Consolas, and the default syntax 
formatting styles were changed. This only affects fresh installs, so your 
existing settings won't change. If you want to reset to the new defaults, exit 
Source Insight. Go to the "Documents\Source Insight\Settings" folder and rename 
"Global.CF3" to something else. Restart SI. 

Change: Several "custom language" extensions are now part of the installation. 
They get installed into the <program directory>\languages folder. They are 
automatically added to the languages list available via Options > Document 
Options. These files were (and still are) available on our web site at 
www.sourceinsight.com/public/languages

Change: Some default settings were changed.

Change: Added additional logging and checking during program initialization.
