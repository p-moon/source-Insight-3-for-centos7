entity) and Source Dynamics, Inc. ("Source Dynamics").  This EULA governs the 
Source Dynamics software identified above, which includes the User Manual, 
any associated software components, any media, any printed materials other 
than the User Manual, and any "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE"). 
By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be 
bound by the terms of this EULA.  If you do not agree to the terms of this 
EULA, Source Dynamics is unwilling to license the SOFTWARE to you.  In such 
event, you may not install, copy, or use the SOFTWARE.  If the SOFTWARE was 
mailed to you, return the media envelope, UNOPENED, along with the rest of 
the package to the location where you obtained it within 30 days from purchase.

copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. 
The SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold. You acknowledge that no title to the

acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the SOFTWARE will remain 
the exclusive property of Source Dynamics and you will not acquire any rights 
to the SOFTWARE except as expressly set forth in this license. You agree that

use the SOFTWARE after the thirty (30) days.  You may not use the Software in 
any manner if you do not pay the license fee and register the SOFTWARE after 
such thirty (30) day period.  If you continue to use the SOFTWARE after the

the SOFTWARE is installed may make a second copy for his or her exclusive use 
on a portable computer.  Under no other circumstances may the SOFTWARE be

have paid a separate license fee.  In virtualization environments, such as a 
terminal server or any other application server environment, you must acquire 
and dedicate a license to the SOFTWARE for each computing device that uses 
the SOFTWARE from the terminal server, application server, or other 
virtualization environment. You may not distribute, copy, or duplicate the 
SOFTWARE in whole or in part, except that you may make one copy of the 
SOFTWARE for backup or archival purposes.  You may terminate this license at 
any time by destroying the original and all copies of the SOFTWARE in

limitation.  You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE.  You may not

collections on CD-ROM, or redistribute the Software in any electronic format 
or otherwise without prior written consent of Source Dynamics in its 
discretion.  The licenses granted to you in this EULA for the SOFTWARE are
